# Aether Project
## About
Created by the James E. Taylor High School Computer Science Club, the Aether Project aimed to collect an assortment of data during the ascent of a large weather balloon. It climed to a peak height of about 107,000 feet, about 3 times the height commercial airliners fly at. Also, its recorded peak speed was 112 miles per hour during its descent back to Earth. Overall, the project was a large success thanks to the collective efforts of all members. All collected data can be viewed on the website.
